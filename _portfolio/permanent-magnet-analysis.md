This is a summary of a project completed along with two fellow students at Lund University in 2016. The full paper can be found [here](/assets/papers/analysis-permanent-magnet.pdf), the paper is based on preparation assignments [1](/assets/papers/EIEN20-1.pdf), [2](/assets/papers/EIEN20-2.pdf), [3](/assets/papers/EIEN20-3.pdf), [4](/assets/papers/EIEN20-4.pdf), & [5](/assets/papers/EIEN20-5.pdf)  

## Introduction
This project was a technical feasability study on magnetic rotors, their qualities and restrictions. It was the first time I had encountered most of the mechanical terms, equations and methods laid out in the assignments for this module, including the Finite Element Method. Our aims for the project were to design a magnetic machine that would deliver enough torque for an electric bike application, while maintaining appropriate size, weight, and efficiency. This was to be achieve through:  

1. Calculation
2. Equivalent circuit analysis with MATLAB
3. Finite Element Method analysis with FEMM
