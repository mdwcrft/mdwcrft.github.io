This is a summary of my 2017 degree dissertation, the full paper can be found [here](/assets/papers/Power-Grid-Architectures-for-Sub-Saharan-Africa.pdf).

## Background

Sub-Saharan Africa, broadly defined as the total area within and south of the Sahara Desert, has by far the lowest levels of electricity access of any region in the world.

This problem is even more severe for rural communities that are outside the reach of national or international grid systems. There are many reasons for this particular inequality; politics, infrastructure, and geography all play a part. One factor unique to Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to other low-income region, is the incredibly low population density (~45 people per sq. km compared to ~375 for South Asia) [source](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.POP.DNST?locations=ZG-8S-Z4). Transporting energy costs money and with a sparse rural population it just isn't cost effective to extend High Voltage power grids. 

The geographic and social reasons for the state of Sub-Sahran Africa are vital to understanding and solving the shortage of electricity. However, the aim of this paper is only to explore engineering solutions, with the aim of decreasing the cost burden for governments and private investors in the African energy system. Areas with significant potential for improvement are energy efficiency, demand management, generation planning, and costing schemes. Specifically, this paper will optimize generation planning, and demand management for a variety of micro-grids and analyse any cost benefits.
