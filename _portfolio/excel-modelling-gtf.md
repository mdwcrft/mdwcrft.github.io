During the summer after Graduation I did some freelance excel formatting work which contributed to a project run by [Sustainable Energy for All](https://www.seforall.org/), a spin-off of the World Bank and the UN. The model was used to predict the cost of full electricity coverage for the whole world by country. The results are documented and used in [The Global Tracking Framework 2015](https://www.seforall.org/sites/default/files/GTF-2105-Full-Report.pdf)/[Key Findings](https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/data/files/download-documents/gtf-2015-key-findings.pdf)/[Summary](http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/Energy/se4all/SE4ALL-Energy-Access-Committee-Report-Corrigendum.pdf).

The report is to be used to assess options for achieving UN Sustainable Development Goal #7: Affordable and Clean Energy.  

 

After finishing University with a [development and energy based dissertation](/portfolio/optimizing-power-grids) this project was perfect for me to work on. The first line of the GTF 2015 Summary states; 
> "The Access Committee has focused on the decentralized, off-grid, mini-grid and clean
cooking elements of the access challenge."  

The model used to draw these conclusions was based partly on known costs and partly on assumptions from experience. In this respect the method is not dissimilar from my dissertation and the conclusions are very similar showing some convergence in modelling output.  

I am unable to share the exact work completed but this project was a great opportunity to gain experience working with large non-profit organisations and learn more about electrification efforts and costs. I also gained valuable Excel skills that I am working to improve continually.
