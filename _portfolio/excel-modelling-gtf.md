During the summer after Graduation I did some freelance excel formatting work which contributed to a project run by [Sustainable Energy for All](https://www.seforall.org/), a spin-off of the World Bank and the UN. The model was used to predict the cost of full electricity coverage for the whole world by country. The results are documented and used in [The Global Tracking Framework 2015/](https://www.seforall.org/sites/default/files/GTF-2105-Full-Report.pdf)[(Key Findings/)](https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/data/files/download-documents/gtf-2015-key-findings.pdf) [(Summary)](http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/Energy/se4all/SE4ALL-Energy-Access-Committee-Report-Corrigendum.pdf).  

After finishing University with a [development and energy based dissertation](/portfolio/optimizing-power-grids) this project was perfect for me to work on. The first line of the GTF 2015 Summary states; "The Access Committee has focused on the decentralized, off-grid, mini-grid and clean
cooking elements of the access challenge.", which followed the findings of my dissertation.
