The [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.co.uk/) Business Decision Making project is part of the University of Nottingham [Advantage Award](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/careers/students/advantageaward/index.aspx) which I completed while studying.  

Capital One is an American financial corporation with an office in Nottingham specialising in consumer credit cards. As part of this project we prepared a memo for Capital One with our business recommendation and presented our ideas to the company at their offices.  

## Problem Statement
[Balance Transfer (BT) Cards](https://www.capitalone.co.uk/creditcards/0-balance-transfer-credit-card-12-months.jsf) are credit cards that offer 0% interest on balances tranferred from another card for a set amount of time, for Capital One the period is 12 months. The market for BT cards is highly competetive and customers are known to jump from BT card to BT card avoiding ever paying interest on their debt, for this reason a one-time transfer fee is often required.  It is also well known that a significant proportion of customers do *not* pay off their balance before the teaser period which means they end up paying interest on their debt.
