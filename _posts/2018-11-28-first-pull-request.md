As I was working through [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) this morning I failed a test and got an error message:  

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/3-test-text.PNG" alt="FreeCodeCamp error message">

Notice anything wrong? The text says "in which the *footer* and *header* areas occupy the *top* and *bottom* rows **respectively**. This is wrong as the header should be at the top so I found the file on [Github](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) and suggested swapping the references to header and footer:

This is my first real pull request on Github! Now we wait for merging...
