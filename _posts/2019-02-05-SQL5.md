DML consists of `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. 
# INSERT
`INSERT` is used to add rows of data to a table. Individual values can be added with `VALUES`  
```sql
INSERT INTO Person ([Name])
VALUES (‘Joe Bloggs’)
```  

A full range can be added using `SELECT`  
```sql
INSERT INTO Person ([Name], DOB, Postcode)
SELECT *
FROM Persontable2
```  
`INSERT` creates a temporary `INSERTED` table during transaction which is a mirror of the original. Rules can be applied to the temp table using **triggers**.  

# UPDATE
`UPDATE` - Can specify values to be entered into columns of an existing table. Creates both `INSERTED` and `DELETED` temporary tables representing the before and after states of the updated table.

# DELETE
There are three versions of `DELETE`, they are:  
- `DROP`: Completely delete table  
- `TRUNCATE`: Total wipe of table, resets ID's, *much* faster than delete.   
- `DELETE`: Deletes all rows in table but ID's remain. Also creates a temporary `DELETED` table that can be triggered on. `DELETED` table means `DELETE` is *slower* than `TRUNCATE`.  

# MERGE  
Merge can be used to update tables in a safe and repeatable way. It will perform an `UPDATE` on existing rows and an `INSERT` on nonexisting rows. If the rows are already ‘matched’ then it will just leave it.  
```sql
MERGE production.product AS TARGET
USING stage.product AS SOURCE
ON TARGET.sku = SOURCE.sku
WHEN MATCHED THEN
	UPDATE SET price=SOURCE.price
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
	INSERT (sku, name, price)
	VALUES (SOURCE.sku, SOURCE.name, SOURCE.price);
```
