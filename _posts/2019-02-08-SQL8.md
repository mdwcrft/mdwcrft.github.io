This is the eight in a series of SQL notes I made during the [Kubrick](https://kubrickgroup.com/) Data Engineering training course. The others are:  
[#1: Database Theory]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL1)  
[#2: Basic SQL]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL2)  
[#3: SELECT]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL3)  
[#4: Sorting]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL4)  
[#5: CTE's, Views & JOIN]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL5)  [#6: INDEX]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL6)  
[#7: Transactions]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL7)  
All the posts in this series are my personal note taking and may be updated as the course progresses.  

# Data Manipulation
### INSERT
`INSERT` - Insert data into an empty table, column by column. Creates a temporary `INSERTED` table during transaction which is a mirror of the original. Rules can be applied to the temp table using **triggers**.  

### UPDATE
`UPDATE` - Can specify values to be entered into columns of an existing table. Creates both `INSERTED` and `DELETED` temporary tables representing the before and after states of the updated table.

### DROP, TRUNCATE, DELETE
`DROP` - Completely delete table  
`TRUNCATE` - Total wipe of table, resets ID's, *much* faster than delete.   
`DELETE` - Deletes all rows in table but ID's remain. Also creates a temporary `DELETED` table that can be triggered on. `DELETED` table means `DELETE` is *slower* than `TRUNCATE`. 

# System Information
`sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats` - Shows usage stats for all indexes  
`sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats` - Shows physical stats for all indexes  

# Other
`FROM OPENROWSET(BULK '<filepath>', SINGLE_CLOB) AS DOCUMENT` - Access an external file
`GETDATE()` - Gets todays date
`DATEDIFF(dd, order_date, GETDATE())` - Difference in days (dd) from order_date to today
