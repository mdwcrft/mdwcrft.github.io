This is the fourth in a series of SQL notes I made during the [Kubrick](https://kubrickgroup.com/) Data Engineering training course. The others are:  
[#1: Database Design]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL1)  
[#2: SQL Design]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL2)  
[#3: DQL]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL3)  
[#5: DML]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL5)  
[#6: Sorting]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL6)  
[#7: Joining]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL7)  
[#8: Temporary Tables]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL8)  
[#9: Programmable Objects]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL9)  
[#10: Indexing]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/SQL10)

All the posts in this series are my personal note taking and may be updated as the course progresses.

Data Definition Language includes the keywords `CREATE`, `DROP`, and `ALTER`. These keywords can be applied to many different SQL objects, a few are databases, schemas, tables, triggers, functions, constraints, and users. Objects in SQL are referred to as securables.  

# CREATE  
`CREATE` is used to create securables like the following example.  
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA schema_1
```  

To create a table just state it
```sql
CREATE TABLE schema_1.product
(
ID INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
Name VARCHAR(200),
Sku VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
Price MONEY
)
```  

`CREATE` is followed by the type of object to create and the name of the object. Inside the brackets are the column names and their respective data types. `NOT NULL` specifies that the field values are not allowed to be `NULL`. `IDENTITY(x,y)` is a function which automatically generates unique numbers, starting at `x` and incrementing by `y`. `PRIMARY KEY` specifies which column should be used as a primary key, this automatically creates a *clustered index* on the table, which allows for faster queries.  

### DECLARE  
`DECLARE` is used to create **variables**, these can be local (within a function) or global. Variables are displayed using `@`, must have a defined data type and can be selected just like a column.  
```sql
DECLARE @dt INT = 20190123
SELECT
	 @dt / 10000 yr
	,@dt / 100 % 100 mnth
	,@dt % 100 dy
```  

# DROP  
`DROP` is the opposite of `CREATE` and will delete an object from storage. A common usage of `DROP` is to add an `IF` statement preceding a `CREATE` statement which checks for the existence of the *object* and if it **does** exist it will `DROP`. This allows for a fresh creation each time the script is run.  
```sql
IF OBJECT_ID(N'product') IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
	DROP TABLE product
END
```  

# ALTER  
`ALTER` is used to make changes to an object which already exists. You can add a new column just using the `ADD` keyword.  
```sql
ALTER TABLE product
ADD Colour VARCHAR(20)
``` 

This could be used to add a `FOREIGN KEY` to a table.  
```sql
ALTER TABLE basket
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_ProductID FOREIGN KEY (ProductID)
REFERENCES product(ID)
```  

An `ALTER` can also be nested to change the type of an existing column for example.  
```sql
ALTER TABLE product
ALTER Colour VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
```  
Or to `DROP` a column.  
```sql
ALTER TABLE product
DROP COLUMN Colour
```  

The *stored procedure* `sp_rename` can be used to rename tables or columns.  
```sql
sp_rename ‘product.colour’, ‘color’, ‘COLUMN’
sp_rename ‘product’, ‘prdct’ 
```
