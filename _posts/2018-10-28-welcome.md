Welcome to my website. I am an Engineer based in the UK with an interest in data & machine learning, energy, policy, and development.  

I hope to use this site firstly as an archive of my thoughts via the [blog](/blog/).<br />

I will also document my major [projects](/projects/), which are based on a variety topics from my time at [The University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/), [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/), and as an Engineering Graduate at [UKAEA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority).  

There is also a page here to find more [about](/about/) me, including my education, work experience, and contact details.  

Thanks for visiting!

I will use the rest of this post as a reference for github markdown syntax which is used in github pages.

Use `single backticks` to highlight code snippets

Tripple backticks for code blocks:
```python
#! python3
import numpy
import pandas
```

Images are like this:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/header-image.png" alt="Some alt text">

Unordered list:
* George Washington

- Thomas Jefferson

Ordered list:
1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams

Nested list:
1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item

Task list:

This is an equation (must add `mathjax: true` to header):
$$z=x+y$$
