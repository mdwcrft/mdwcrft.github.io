Hi, my name is Chad Meadowcroft. I'm a data analyst in London with a background in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I'm interested in Data, Software, Machine Learning, Physics, Energy, Economics, Politics, Philosophy, Psychology, Music, Photography, and Running. 

This website serves as a place for me to store my [Portfolio](/portfolio/) of projects, [Blog](/blog/) about a variety of subjects, and display my [CV](/cv/). It was built using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
